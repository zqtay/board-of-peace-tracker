# Board of Peace Tracker
This is a page to track Board of Peace membership status of each invited states.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Peace):

> The Board of Peace is an international organization established by United States president Donald Trump that is nominally purposed to promote peacekeeping. The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established in January 2026.

Around 60 countries received invitation to participate in this organization, and some of them has since given response.  

This page will periodically scrape the information from the Wikipedia page, and present the membership status in an interactive map.
